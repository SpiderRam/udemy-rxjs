[Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/rxjs-101-course/) by Matthew Keener

NOTE: the course looked great because it is framework agnostic (just JavaScript). But it's outdated and the two APIs needed for the final project are not free. Even better, one of them no longer allows new sign-ups.

So, the work for this is found on the branches, one for each section. No project code-along, just watched the videos for the last section.

I added [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) and [source-map-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-loader).

To run the code:

-   check out the branch of your choice
-   `npm i`
-   `npm run start`
-   You may need to comment in or out elements in dist/index.html depending on which file you view, and you will need to change the active import in src/index.js
-   on 7-41 (branch subjects), you will have to add your own .mp3 file to the dist folder.

Sections 3-15 (branch creators) and 7-41 (branch subjects) are neat but not really about rxjs.
