\*\* This section is not great, too much emphasis on the clock and helper code, very little rxjs content

### FROM

> from([1, 2, 3, 4])

-   takes an array as an argument

### OF

> of(1, 2, 3, 4)

-   takes any number of arguments

### INTERVAL

> interval(1000)

-   in JavaScript setTimeout() and setInterval() execute a callback
-   the rxjs equivalent creates an observable stream on an interval or timer

### RANGE

-   Will start at 1 and count up 100 values, 1-100
-   rang(50, 50) would start at 50 and count to 99
